# Cheesecake for Twitter - Design Mockup

This is a personal project where I recreated a design mockup from Figma for a concept called "Cheesecake for Twitter." The goal of the project is to improve layout, responsiveness, and styling skills using **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript**.
The project is designed with a **mobile-first** approach and is fully **responsive** across different screen sizes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
    ```
        git clone [repository link]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
    ```
        cd cheesecake-for-twitter
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the design in action.

#   SCSS Setup (If you need to compile SCSS to CSS): 
If you want to make changes to the styles or work with the SCSS files directly, follow these steps to compile SCSS to CSS:

1. Install dependencies (if you're using npm):
   
    ```
        npm install
    ```

2. Compile SCSS to CSS::
   
    ```
        npm run compile-scss
    ```

    Alternatively, if you only want to view the design as is, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser, and the precompiled CSS will be used.

#   Usage
This project is a static design mockup, and the primary goal is to showcase a mobile-first, responsive layout.

#   Technologies Used
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript

# Design Approach
- Mobile-First Design: The layout was built with a mobile-first approach, meaning it is optimized for mobile devices initially, with styles progressively enhanced for larger screens using media queries.

- Responsive Design: The project is designed to adjust seamlessly across various screen sizesâ€”from small mobile devices to large desktop monitors. Media queries ensure that the design looks great on all devices.

- Flexbox and CSS Grid: These modern layout techniques were used to create flexible, fluid designs that adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining visual integrity.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to:

- Improve mobile-first and responsive web design skills by converting a static Figma mockup into a working, responsive webpage.
- Practice SCSS for more efficient, modular, and maintainable CSS.
